  <b>So here's what you do:</b><br />
  <b>Add datasets</b> you like to your collection. Also <b>add analytical functions</b> you want to have run on your collection once it's frozen.<br />
  When you're very happy with the datasets and analytics you've added, <b>freeze your collection</b>.<br />
  When you freeze a collection, you won't be able to add any more datasets or analysis.<br />
  As soon as your collection is frozen, the analytical functions you chose will be scheduled to run on it. Results will be available right here on this page when they're ready.
